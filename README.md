The impact of climate change on ecosystems, economies, and civilisations makes it one of the 21st century's most urgent issues, according to growing consensus. Climate change's localised effects, which include rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and a rise in the frequency of extreme weather events, have a significant influence on a number of industries, including public health, infrastructure, and agriculture. Planning and adaption efforts in areas such as Hatfield require a localised awareness and prediction of these changes.
Climate models have historically offered general predictions at regional or global scales, but they frequently lack the detail required to precisely represent localised climate processes. Furthermore, these models might be prohibitively expensive in terms of processing resources, particularly when it comes to continuous, real-time prediction. Therefore, there is a rising demand for more user-friendly and precise approaches to local temperature change prediction utilising existing data.
In order to achieve this, we applied machine learning to create a precise prediction method utilising a database of monthly temperatures for the Hatfield region. Temperature graphs are not linear. Time series analysis also makes use of Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Decision Tree (DT), and XG Boost Regressor (XGB), in addition to machine learning (ML). 
Rising temperatures are one of the most evident and measurable effects of climate change, putting human health, economies, and ecosystems at grave risk. For the purpose of creating mitigation measures, adapting to changing conditions, and directing policy decisions, future temperature trends must be predicted. While traditional methods like Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) produce reliable predictions, they require a large amount of processing power and expertise. However, machine learning (ML) has the ability to analyse massive datasets and identify complex patterns within them.
The objective of this research is to create and assess temperature prediction models using historical climate data from the Bayford bury Observatory. The dataset from the observatory offers a wealth of data by capturing several meteorological variables over a long time. Through the use of time series analytic tools, this work aims to develop models that provide insights into the fundamental causes of temperature variations in addition to making very accurate predictions about future temperatures. The study tackles the demand for easily available, expandable, and precise prediction instruments that may be utilised in many settings, ranging from regional environmental governance to Hatfield climate simulation.
